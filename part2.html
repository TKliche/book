<h1>MQTT</h1>

<div class="partintro">

<p>This book covers the latest released version of the protocol at the time of this writing: MQTT 3.1 <a data-type="xref" href="#mqttv3.1"></a>.</p>

<p>MQTT is a simple and lightweight messaging protocol that only supports the <em>Publish/Subscribe</em> messaging model.</p>

<p>MQTT is a binary protocol and its wireformat (the bits that are sent over the wire) is very compact reducing bandwidth and memory usage. It defines a small set of features and there are clients for it on many platforms ranging from traditional operating systems to embedded devices. In the next two chapters, we will write a mobile application for iOS and a Web application but the description of the MQTT protocol applies to any client (although their API may differ).</p>

<h1>Eclipse Public MQTT Server</h1>

<p>For the MQTT <code>Motions</code> application, we will not run a MQTT broker on our local network but use instead a public MQTT broker hosted by <a href="http://iot.eclipse.org/sandbox.html#mqtt">iot.eclipse.org</a>, the portal for Internet of Things development of the Eclipse foundation. This public broker is running using the Mosquitto project (the same codebase underneath MQTTKit) and any MQTT client can connect to it. While it is not appropriate to use it for production (there is no uptime guarantee for it), it shows that it is possible to use MQTT on Internet.</p>

<p>MQTT clients can connect to it using the <code>iot.eclipse.org</code> hostname on the port <code>1883</code> (that is reserved for MQTT).</p>
