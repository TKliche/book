== Advanced STOMP

[role="lead"]
In the two previous chapters, we have used STOMP to send and receive messages from a native iOS app and from a Web applications.
STOMP provides additional features that we did not use. In this chapter, we will make a tour of all the features provided by STOMP.

STOMP provides an interoperable wire format so that clients can communicate with any message broker.
The simplicity of the protocol ensures that it's straightforward to have interoperability between any client and brokers.

This chapter covers the latest version of the protocol when this book was written:
http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html[STOMP 1.2] that was released on 2012, October 22^nd^.
