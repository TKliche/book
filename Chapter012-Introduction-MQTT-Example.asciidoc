=== +Motions+ Application Using MQTT

TODO

. In <<ch_mobile_mqtt>>, we will write the +Motions+ iOS application using the MQTT protocol to send data about the device motions and receive alerts.
. In <<ch_web_mqtt>>, we will write a Web application using MQTT protocol over Web Sockets to receive all the device motions data and display them. The Web application will also be able to send alert messages to any devices sending its motions data.

==== Motions Messaging Topology

In this application we will use two destination with the Publish/Subscribe model:

* +/mwm/XXX/motion+ is the topic to broadcast the device motion data:  where +XXX+ is the device identifier (Publish/Subscribe model)
* +/mwm/XXX/alert+ is the topic to receive alert messages (Publish/Subscribe model)

Each device running the +Motions+ application will be:

* a _producer_ of messages to the topic +/mwm/XXX/motion+
* a _consumer_ of messages from the topic +/mwm/XXX/alert+

Conversely, the Web application will be:

* a _consumer_ of messages from all the topics +/mwm/XXX/motion+
* a _producer_ of message from all the topics +/mwm/XXX/alert+
