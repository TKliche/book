=== +Motions+ Application Using MQTT

TODO

. In <<ch_mobile_mqtt>>, we will write the +Motions+ iOS application using the MQTT protocol to send data about the device motions and receive alerts.
. In <<ch_web_mqtt>>, we will write a Web application using MQTT protocol over Web Sockets to receive all the device motions data and display them. The Web application will also be able to send alert messages to any devices sending its motions data.
