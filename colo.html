  <p>The animal on the cover of <em>Mobile and Web Messaging</em> is is a song thrush (<em>Turdus philomelos</em>), a small bird that ranges throughout Europe and western Asia. Its scientific name comes from the Latin word for thrush, as well as the mythological Greek character Philomela, who was transformed into a songbird after her tongue was cut out.</p>
  
 <p>The song thrush is about 8-9 inches long and typically weighs 2-4 ounces. It has brown plumage on its back, and a light belly with black spots. Despite being a smaller bird, it has one of the loudest bird calls. Male song thrushes, in particular, are capable of learning more than 100 different calls, including imitations of other birds and manmade objects like telephones. </p>

<p>Song thrushes are omnivorous; their diet is mainly made up of insects, worms, fruit, and berries. They also eat snails, and have the unique habit of tapping the shells against rocks to get to the meat inside. Known as "snail anvils," these stones and the remains of snails are often found in areas where thrushes live. While thrushes usually nest in forests with thick undergrowth, in more developed areas such as England, the birds are most often found in gardens.</p>
