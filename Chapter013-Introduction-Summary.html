<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we learnt about the messaging protocols and how they differ from request/reply protocols. We introduced two messaging models - <em>Point-to-Point</em> and <em>Publish/Subscribe</em> - and the parts that compose a message - <em>destination</em>, <em>headers</em>, and <em>payload</em>.</p>

<p>We have also described the two applications with their messaging models and representation that will be written in the subsequent chapters: the <code>Locations</code> application that uses STOMP and the <code>Motions</code> applications that uses MQTT.</p>

<p>In the next chapter, we will start writing the <code>Locations</code> application running on iOS devices. If you are more interested by learning about MQTT, you can go directly to <a data-type="xref" href="#ch_mobile_mqtt"/> to start writing the <code>Motions</code> application.</p>
