== STOMP

[role="lead"]
In this chapter, we present the STOMP protocol, a simple text-based messaging
protocol that is well suited to build simple lightweight messaging applications on any platforms.

STOMP provides an interoperable wire format so that clients can communicate with any message broker.
The simplicity of the protocol ensures that it's straightforward to have interoperability between any client and brokers.

This chapter covers the latest released version of the protocol:
http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html[STOMP 1.2]

=== Anatomy of a STOMP Frame

STOMP is modelled on HTTP and based on _frames_. Each frame is composed of 3 elements:

* a _command_
* an (optional) set of _headers_
* an (optional) _payload_

.STOMP Frame Structure
----
COMMAND
header1:value1
header2:value2

payload^@
----

STOMP is based on text (with UTF-8 as its default encoding)
but it can also transmit binary data in its payload by specifying an altenative encoding.

A STOMP client can serve two roles:

. it can be a _producer_ and send messages using a +SEND+ frame
(that is a frame with the +SEND+ command)
. it can be a _consumer_ and subscribe to receive messages using a +SUBSCRIBE+ frame.
Each received messages will be delivered by the broker to the client as +MESSAGE+ frames.

+SEND+, +SUBSCRIBE+, +MESSAGE+, along with the +CONNECT+ (resp. +DISCONNECT+) frame used to connect (resp. disconnect) to the messaging broker,
are the most important frames.
Other frames correspond to additional features (message acknowledgement, transaction, error handling).

==== Headers

Any STOMP frame accepts an optional set of headers.

Some headers are defined in the specification and are mandatory for a given frame.
For example, a +SEND+ frame must have a +destination+ header to indicate the destination of the messages.
Other headers are optional.
For example, if a +SEND+ frame contains a payload, it should also include both +content-type+ and +content-length+ headers.

==== Payload

Only +SEND+, +MESSAGE+ and +ERROR+ frames can contain payload.

The payload in +SEND+ and +MESSAGE+ are the data that are exchanged.

A messaging broker may send +ERROR+ frames to the client if something went wrong.
The +ERROR+ frame may contain a payload with detailed information about the problem
(in addition to a short description in a +message+ header).

=== Connection

.Install and configure a messaging broker
[IMPORTANT]
====
Before using a STOMP client, we have to install and configure a messaging broker to
communicate with it.

In the book, we use Apache ActiveMQ as the messaging broker. The <<appendix_activemq>>
appendix shows how to install and configure ActiveMQ with STOMP.

Once ActiveMQ has been started, it will accept STOMP connections on +localhost:61613+.
====

Since STOMP is text-based, we can send and receive message from the command line
using a +telnet+ client.

----
$ telnet localhost 61613
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
----

Once we are connected to the broker, the first step is to send a +CONNECT+ frame
to establish a STOMP connection:

.Connect to a STOMP broker
----
CONNECT
accept-version: 1.2

^@
----

We indicate a +accept-version+ header with the value +1.2+ to be able to communicate
with the broker using the version 1.2 of the protocol.

A STOMP frame must be ended by a NULL octet.
The +^@+ is the ASCII character for NULL octet. Type +ctrl + @+ to enter it.

Note also that there is a blank line between the +accept-version+ header and the NULL octet.
The blank line is mandatory to determine the end of the headers and the beginning
of the optional payload (that is not present in the +CONNECT+ frame).

Once you type +ctrl + @+, the messaging broker will handle the +CONNECT+ frame
and reply with a +CONNECTED+ frame:

.Receive a connection confirmation
----
CONNECTED
heart-beat:0,0
session:ID:retsina.local-64904-1378366884467-2:1
server:ActiveMQ/5.8.0
version:1.2
----

If there was any problem during the connection, an +ERROR+ frame would have been returned.

=== Send a Message

Now that the telnet client is connected to the messaging broker, we can send a message to a destination.

STOMP clients can send message to _destinations_ that are opaque strings specific to each messaging broker implementation.
STOMP itself has no notion of delivery semantics (whether a destination is a queue, a topic or another exchange types)
and you have to consult the messaging broker documentation to check how to name the destination for STOMP.

.Send a message
----
SEND
destination: /queue/myqueue

Hello, STOMP!^@
----

This +SEND+ frame contains +destination+ header to indicate the destination of the message.

It also contains payload with the text content +Hello, STOMP!+.
The payload is immediately followed by the NULL octet +^@+ to end the frame.

Once you type +ctrl + @+, the message is processed by the broker.

[NOTE]
====
ActiveMQ convention is to prefix the destination by +/queue/+ to send to a queue.
To send to a topic, we would have used +/topic/mytopic+ instead.

ActiveMQ will automatically create a destination based on the +destination+ header so we do not have to create it beforehands.
Other brokers may behave differently and require to create the destination before sending any messages to it.
====

==== Frame Receiption
If you want some feedback and know that a message has indeed be received by the broker, you can use a +receipt+ header with an ID to ask for a +RECEIPT+ frame

.Send a message with a receipt
----
SEND
destination: /queue/myqueue
receipt: 123

Hello, STOMP with a receipt!^@
----

When this +SEND+ frame is sent, the server will reply with a +RECEIPT+ frame
containing the corresponding receipt ID in a +receipt-id+ header:

.Receive the receipt
----
RECEIPT
receipt-id: 123

----

==== Error frame

If we send a message with an invalid format, the messaging broker will reply immediately with an +ERROR+ frame.
For example, let's try to send a +SEND+ frame without its mandatory +destination+ header:

.Send an invalid message
----
SEND

A SEND frame witout a destination is not allowed^@
----

We immediately receive an +ERROR+ frame in the telnet client:

.Receive an error
----
ERROR
content-type:text/plain
message:SEND received without a Destination specified!

org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp.ProtocolException: SEND received without a Destination specified!
        at org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp.ProtocolConverter.onStompSend(ProtocolConverter.java:299)
        at org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp.ProtocolConverter.onStompCommand(ProtocolConverter.java:233)
        ...

=== Receive a Message

So far, we have use telnet client as a STOMP _producer_ to send messages.

We will now use it as a STOMP _consumer_ to receive the messages we have sent.

To receive messages, a STOMP client must send a +SUBSCRIBE+ with a +destination+ header.

.Subscribe to a destination
----
SUBSCRIBE
destination: /queue/myqueue
id: mysub

^@
----

We must also indicate a +id+ header that corresponds to the subscription ID.
It is the responsibility of the client to choose this ID.

As soon as the messaging broker will receive this +SUBSCRIBE+ frame,
it will start to send to the STOMP client +MESSAGE+ frames corresponding to the message sent to this destination.

.Receive two messages
----
MESSAGE
message-id:ID\cretsina.local-64904-1378366884467-2\c1\c-1\c1\c1
destination:/queue/myqueue
timestamp:1378367602698
expires:0
priority:4

Hello, STOMP!
MESSAGE
message-id:ID\cretsina.local-64904-1378366884467-2\c1\c-1\c1\c2
destination:/queue/myqueue
timestamp:1378368275375
expires:0
priority:4

Hello, STOMP with a receipt!
----

We have received the 2 messages that we have previously sent.

The telnet client is now both a producer and a consumer. If we send another message, we will receive it immediately:

.Send a message
----
SEND
destination:/queue/myqueue

another message^@
----

.Receive the message immediately
----
MESSAGE
message-id:ID\cretsina.local-64904-1378366884467-2\c3\c-1\c1\c3
destination:/queue/myqueue
timestamp:1378369910799
expires:0
subscription: mysub
priority:4

another message
----

=== Unsubscription

To stop consuming messages from a destination, the client must send a +UNSUBSCRIBE+ frame
with a +id+ header corresponding to the subscription ID indicated in the +SUBSCRIBE+ frame (+mysub+ in the example above).

.Unsubscribe a consumer
----
UNSUBSCRIBE
id: mysub

^@
----

The telnet client can still send messages but it will no longer receive those sent to the +queue/myqueue+ destination.

=== Disconnection
To disconnect from the messaging broker, the client must send a +DISCONNECT+ frame.

To ensure a graceful disconnection, the best practice is to send a +DISCONNECT+ frame
with a +receipt+ header and wait to receive the corresponding +RECEIPT+ frame.
The client can then safely close the socket that is connected to the messaging broker.

.Grafecul disconnection
----
DISCONNECT
receipt: 456

^@
----

When the +DISCONNECT+ frame is sent, the client receives the corresponding +RECEIPT+ frame.

.Receive a receipt for the graceful disconnection
----
RECEIPT
receipt-id: 456
----

The messaging broker then closes its socket and the telnet client is closed:

----
Connection closed by foreign host.
